## Project Overview

Welcome to the WebRTC-P2P File Transfer System project! This project represents a comprehensive investigation into the integration of WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology into a peer-to-peer (P2P) file transfer system. Our goal is to revolutionize the way data is exchanged and delivered, leveraging the transformative potential of this integration.

### Key Highlights

- Explored the principles of P2P computing, emphasizing equal participation, resource sharing, and hybrid network architectures.
- Integrated WebRTC, a protocol designed for lightweight browser-to-browser communication, eliminating reliance on centralized servers.
- Implemented a robust encoding method involving randomized data packet shuffling and SHA-256 encryption to enhance security.
- Conducted rigorous testing, including unit, integration, and security assessments, ensuring robustness and reliability.
- Provided user training sessions to empower individuals to use direct browser-based P2P file transfers.
- Ensured continuous optimization and security enhancements through routine maintenance and updates.

## Project Goals

My project serves as a pioneering effort in the domain of distributed file sharing through Web-based P2P mechanisms. It showcases the transformative potential of WebRTC and P2P integration, not only in the realm of file sharing but also in shaping the future of technology, including Internet of Things (IoT), smartphones, cloud computing, and even space science.

## Theory

### P2P Computing Principles

P2P computing is based on the ideals of equal participation, resource sharing, and hybrid network architectures. In this project, we leverage these principles to create an efficient P2P file transfer system.

### WebRTC Integration

The integration of WebRTC, a protocol designed for browser-to-browser communication, eliminates the need for centralized servers. It offers a direct and efficient means of sharing information in a P2P architecture.

### Security Measures

To enhance security, we implemented a special encoding method that involves randomized data packet shuffling and robust SHA-256 encryption. These measures ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transferred files.
